  abstract = {Neutral kaons, and probably also neutrinos, exhibit oscillations between flavor eigenstates, as a result of being produced in a superposition of mass eigenstates. Several recent papers have addressed the question of the energies and momenta of the components of these states, and their effect on the coherence of the states and on the wavelength of the oscillations. We point out that the mass eigenstates need have neither equal momentum nor equal energy, but can nevertheless be coherent, and that a correct treatment of the kinematics recovers the usual result for the wavelength of the flavor oscillations.

  abstract = {The knowledge of the initial flux in conventional neutrino beams represents the main limitation for a precision (1\%) measurement of  ŒΩ e ùúà ùëí  and  ŒΩ Œº ùúà ùúá  cross-sections. The ENUBET ERC project is studying a facility based on a narrow-band beam capable of constraining the neutrino fluxes normalization through the monitoring of the associated charged leptons in an instrumented decay tunnel. In particular, the identification of large-angle positrons from  K e3 ùêæ ùëí 3  decays at single-particle level can reduce the  ŒΩ e ùúà ùëí  flux uncertainty at the level of 1\%. This setup would allow for an unprecedented measurement of the  ŒΩ e ùúà ùëí  cross-section at the GeV scale. Such an experimental input would be highly beneficial to reduce the budget of systematic uncertainties in the next long baseline oscillation experiments. The ENUBET Collaboration presented at ICNFP 2020 the advances in the design and simulation of the hadron beamline, the optimization and performances of a 20 m long focusing transfer line, the design of an horn-based beamline, the results in terms of particle identification in the decay tunnel, and the final design of the ENUBET demonstrator for the instrumented decay tunnel.},

  abstract = {Neutrinos exist in one of three types or ‚Äòflavours‚Äô‚Äîelectron, muon and tau neutrinos‚Äîand oscillate from one flavour to another when propagating through space. This phenomena is one of the few that cannot be described using the standard model of particle physics (reviewed in ref.\,1), and so its experimental study can provide new insight into the nature of our Universe (reviewed in ref.\,2). Neutrinos oscillate as a function of their propagation distance (L) divided by their energy (E). Therefore, experiments extract oscillation parameters by measuring their energy distribution at different locations. As accelerator-based oscillation experiments cannot directly measure E, the interpretation of these experiments relies heavily on phenomenological models of neutrino‚Äìnucleus interactions to infer E. Here we exploit the similarity of electron‚Äìnucleus and neutrino‚Äìnucleus interactions, and use electron scattering data with known beam energies to test energy reconstruction methods and interaction models. We find that even in simple interactions where no pions are detected, only a small fraction of events reconstruct to the correct incident energy. More importantly, widely used interaction models reproduce the reconstructed energy distribution only qualitatively and the quality of the reproduction varies strongly with beam energy. This shows both the need and the pathway to improve current models to meet the requirements of next-generation, high-precision experiments such as Hyper-Kamiokande (Japan)3 and DUNE~(USA)4.},

  abstract = {When Kai Zuber's pioneering text on neutrinos was published in 2003, the author correctly predicted that the field would see tremendous growth in the immediate future. In that book, Professor Zuber provided a comprehensive self-contained examination of neutrinos, covering their research history and theory, as well as their application to particle physics, astrophysics, nuclear physics, and the broad reach of cosmology; but now to be truly comprehensive and accurate, the field's seminal reference needs to be revised and expanded to include the latest research, conclusions, and implications. Revised as needed to be equal to the research of today, Neutrino Physics, Third Edition delves into neutrino cross-sections, mass measurements, double beta decay, solar neutrinos, neutrinos from supernovae, and high-energy neutrinos, as well as entirely new experimental results in the context of theoretical models. Written to be accessible to graduate students and readers from diverse backgrounds, this edition, like the first, provides both an introduction to the field as well as the information needed by those looking to make their own contributions to it. And like the second edition, it whets the researcher's appetite, going beyond certainty to pose those questions that still need answers. Features Presents the only single-author comprehensive text on neutrino physics Includes experimental and theoretical particle physics and examines solar neutrinos and astroparticle implications Offers details on new developments and recent experiments},
