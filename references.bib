  abstract = {The charge-conjugation and parity-reversal (CP) symmetry of fundamental particles is a symmetry between matter and antimatter. Violation of this CP symmetry was first observed in 19641, and CP violation in the weak interactions of quarks was soon established2. Sakharov proposed3 that CP violation is necessary to explain the observed imbalance of matter and antimatter abundance in the Universe. However, CP violation in quarks is too small to support this explanation. So far, CP violation has not been observed in non-quark elementary particle systems. It has been shown that CP violation in leptons could generate the matter–antimatter disparity through a process called leptogenesis4. Leptonic mixing, which appears in the standard model’s charged current interactions5,6, provides a potential source of CP violation through a complex phase δCP, which is required by some theoretical models of leptogenesis7–9. This CP violation can be measured in muon neutrino to electron neutrino oscillations and the corresponding antineutrino oscillations, which are experimentally accessible using accelerator-produced beams as established by the Tokai-to-Kamioka (T2K) and NOvA experiments10,11. Until now, the value of δCP has not been substantially constrained by neutrino oscillation experiments. Here we report a measurement using long-baseline neutrino and antineutrino oscillations observed by the T2K experiment~that shows a large increase in the neutrino oscillation probability, excluding values of δCP that result in a large increase in the observed antineutrino oscillation probability at three standard deviations (3σ). The 3σ confidence interval for δCP, which is cyclic and repeats every 2π, is [−3.41, −0.03] for the so-called normal mass ordering and [−2.54, −0.32] for the inverted mass ordering. Our results indicate CP violation in leptons~and our method enables sensitive searches for matter–antimatter asymmetry in neutrino oscillations using accelerator-produced neutrino beams. Future measurements with larger datasets will test whether leptonic CP violation is larger than the CP violation in quarks.},

  abstract = {The T2K experiment is a long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment. Its main goal is to measure the last unknown lepton sector mixing angle θ13 by observing νe appearance in a νμ beam. It also aims to make a precision measurement of the known oscillation parameters, Δm232 and sin22θ23, via νμ disappearance studies. Other goals of the experiment include various neutrino cross-section measurements and sterile neutrino searches. The experiment uses an intense proton beam generated by the J-PARC accelerator in Tokai, Japan, and is composed of a neutrino beamline, a near detector complex (ND280), and a far detector (Super-Kamiokande) located 295km away from J-PARC. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the instrumentation aspect of the T2K experiment and a summary of the vital information for each subsystem.},

  abstract = {The precise measurement of neutrino properties is among the highest priorities in fundamental particle physics, involving many experiments worldwide. Since the experiments rely on the interactions of neutrinos with bound nucleons inside atomic nuclei, the planned advances in the scope and precision of these experiments require a commensurate effort in the understanding and modeling of the hadronic and nuclear physics of these interactions, which is incorporated as a nuclear model in neutrino event generators. This model is essential to every phase of experimental analyses and its theoretical uncertainties play an important role in interpreting every result. In this White Paper we discuss in detail the impact of neutrino–nucleus interactions, especially the nuclear effects, on the measurement of neutrino properties using the determination of oscillation parameters as a central example. After an Executive Summary and a concise Overview of the issues, we explain how the neutrino event generators work, what can be learned from electron–nucleus interactions and how each underlying physics process – from quasi-elastic to deep inelastic scattering – is understood today. We then emphasize how our understanding must improve to meet the demands of future experiments. With every topic we find that the challenges can be met only with the active support and collaboration among specialists in strong interactions and electroweak physics that include theorists and experimentalists from both the nuclear and high energy physics communities.},

The goal of the project is to develop a ‘canonical’ neutrino interaction physics Monte Carlo whose validity extends to all nuclear targets and neutrino flavors from MeV to PeV energy scales. Currently, emphasis is on the few-GeV energy range, the challenging boundary between the non-perturbative and perturbative regimes, which is relevant for the current and near future long-baseline precision neutrino experiments using accelerator-made beams. The design of the package addresses many challenges unique to neutrino simulations and supports the full life-cycle of simulation and generator-related analysis tasks. GENIE is a large-scale software system, consisting of ∼120000 lines of C++ code, featuring a modern object-oriented design and extensively validated physics content.

  abstract = {The CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer for operation at 12~GeV beam energy (CLAS12) in Hall~B at Jefferson Laboratory is used to study electro-induced nuclear and hadronic reactions. This spectrometer provides efficient detection of charged and neutral particles over a large fraction of the full solid angle. CLAS12 has been part of the energy-doubling project of Jefferson Lab’s Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility, funded by the United States Department of Energy. An international collaboration of 48 institutions contributed to the design and construction of detector hardware, developed the software packages for the simulation of complex event patterns, and commissioned the detector systems. CLAS12 is based on a dual-magnet system with a superconducting torus magnet that provides a largely azimuthal field distribution that covers the forward polar angle range up to 35∘, and a solenoid magnet and detector covering the polar angles from 35° to 125° with full azimuthal coverage. Trajectory reconstruction in the forward direction using drift chambers and in the central direction using a vertex tracker results in momentum resolutions of {$<$}1\% and {$<$}3\%, respectively. Cherenkov counters, time-of-flight scintillators, and electromagnetic calorimeters provide good particle identification. Fast triggering and high data-acquisition rates allow operation at a luminosity of 1035~cm−2s−1. These capabilities are being used in a broad program to study the structure and interactions of nucleons, nuclei, and mesons, using polarized and unpolarized electron beams and targets for beam energies up to 11~GeV. This paper gives a general description of the design, construction, and performance of CLAS12.},

We argue that while Majorana phases do affect the strength of neutrinoless double beta decay (a well known fact), they do so in a way that involves no manifest violation of CP. The conditions for manifestly CP-violating phenomena—differences between the rates for CP-mirror-image processes—are presented, and three examples are discussed: (i) neutrino ↔ antineutrino oscillation; (ii) rare decays of K and B mesons and their antiparticles; and (iii) the lepton asymmetry generated by the decay of hypothetical very heavy right-handed “seesaw” neutrinos. We also find that, for the case of degenerate light neutrinos, manifestly CP-violating effects in neutrino ↔ antineutrino oscillation vanish, although flavor-changing transitions do not. Finally, we comment on leptogenesis with degenerate right-handed neutrinos, and contrast it with the neutrino ↔ antineutrino oscillation case.},

The ENUBET ERC project is studying a facility based on a narrow-band beam capable of constraining the neutrino fluxes normalization through the monitoring of the associated charged leptons in an instrumented decay tunnel. In particular, the identification of large-angle positrons from  K e3 𝐾 𝑒 3  decays at single-particle level can reduce the  ν e 𝜈 𝑒  flux uncertainty at the level of 1\%. This setup would allow for an unprecedented measurement of the  ν e 𝜈 𝑒  cross-section at the GeV scale. Such an experimental input would be highly beneficial to reduce the budget of systematic uncertainties in the next long baseline oscillation experiments. The ENUBET Collaboration presented at ICNFP 2020 the advances in the design and simulation of the hadron beamline, the optimization and performances of a 20 m long focusing transfer line, the design of an horn-based beamline, the results in terms of particle identification in the decay tunnel, and the final design of the ENUBET demonstrator for the instrumented decay tunnel.},

  abstract = {The extraction of neutrino mixing parameters from accelerator-based neutrino-oscillation experiments relies on proper modeling of neutrino-nucleus scattering processes using neutrino interaction event generators. Experimental tests of these generators are difficult due to the broad range of neutrino energies produced in accelerator-based beams and the low statistics of current experiments. Here we overcome these difficulties by exploiting the similarity of neutrino and electron interactions with nuclei to test neutrino event generators using high-precision inclusive electron-scattering data. To this end, we revised the electron-scattering mode of the genie event generator (e-genie) to include electron-nucleus bremsstrahlung radiation effects and to use, when relevant, the exact same physics models and model parameters, as the standard neutrino-scattering version. We also implemented new models for quasielastic (QE) scattering and meson exchange currents (MECs) based on the theory-inspired super scaling approach SuSAv2. Comparing the new e-genie predictions with inclusive electron-scattering data, we find an overall adequate description of the data in the QE- and MEC-dominated lower energy transfer regime, especially when using the SuSAv2 models. Higher energy transfer interactions, which are dominated by resonance production, are still not well modeled by e-genie.},

  abstract = {Current neutrino experiments are measuring the neutrino mixing parameters with an unprecedented accuracy. The upcoming generation of neutrino experiments will be sensitive to subdominant neutrino oscillation effects that can in principle give information on the yet-unknown neutrino parameters: the Dirac CP-violating phase in the PMNS mixing matrix, the neutrino mass ordering and the octant of θ23. Determining the exact values of neutrino mass and mixing parameters is crucial to test various neutrino models and flavor symmetries that are designed to predict these neutrino parameters. In the first part of this review, we summarize the current status of the neutrino oscillation parameter determination. We consider the most recent data from all solar neutrino experiments and the atmospheric neutrino data from Super-Kamiokande, IceCube, and ANTARES. We also implement the data from the reactor neutrino experiments KamLAND, Daya Bay, RENO, and Double Chooz as well as the long baseline neutrino data from MINOS, T2K, and NOνA. If in addition to the standard interactions, neutrinos have subdominant yet-unknown Non-Standard Interactions (NSI) with matter fields, extracting the values of these parameters will suffer from new degeneracies and ambiguities. We review such effects and formulate the conditions on the NSI parameters under which the precision measurement of neutrino oscillation parameters can be distorted. Like standard weak interactions, the non-standard interaction can be categorized into two groups: Charged Current (CC) NSI and Neutral Current (NC) NSI. Our focus will be mainly on neutral current NSI because it is possible to build a class of models that give rise to sizeable NC NSI with discernible effects on neutrino oscillation. These models are based on new U(1) gauge symmetry with a gauge boson of mass ≲ 10 MeV. The UV complete model should be of course electroweak invariant which in general implies that along with neutrinos, charged fermions also acquire new interactions on which there are strong bounds. We enumerate the bounds that already exist on the electroweak symmetric models and demonstrate that it is possible to build viable models avoiding all these bounds. In the end, we review methods to test these models and suggest approaches to break the degeneracies in deriving neutrino mass parameters caused by NSI.},

  abstract = {Since its original postulation by Wolfgang Pauli in 1930, the neutrino has played a prominent role in our understanding of nuclear and particle physics. In the intervening 80 years, scientists have detected and measured neutrinos from a variety of sources, both man made and natural. Underlying all of these observations, and any inferences we may have made from them, is an understanding of how neutrinos interact with matter. Knowledge of neutrino interaction cross sections is an important and necessary ingredient in any neutrino measurement. With the advent of new precision experiments, the demands on our understanding of neutrino interactions is becoming even greater. The purpose of this article is to survey our current knowledge of neutrino cross sections across all known energy scales: from the very lowest energies to the highest that we hope to observe. The article covers a wide range of neutrino interactions including coherent scattering, neutrino capture, inverse beta decay, low-energy nuclear interactions, quasielastic scattering, resonant pion production, kaon production, deep inelastic scattering, and ultrahigh energy interactions. Strong emphasis is placed on experimental data whenever such measurements are available.},

  abstract = {Neutrino oscillations physics is entering an era of high precision. In this context, accelerator-based neutrino experiments need a reduction in systematic errors to the level of a few percent. Today, one of the most important sources of systematic errors are neutrino–nucleus cross sections which, in the energy region of hundreds of MeV to a few GeV, are known to a precision not exceeding 20\%. In this article we review the present experimental and theoretical knowledge of neutrino–nucleus interaction physics. After introducing neutrino-oscillation physics and accelerator-based neutrino experiments, we give an overview of general aspects of neutrino–nucleus cross sections, from both the theoretical and experimental point of view. Then, we focus on these cross sections in different reaction channels. We start with the quasi-elastic and quasi-elastic-like cross section, placing a special emphasis on the multinucleon emission channel, which has attracted a lot of attention in the last few years. We review the main aspects of the different microscopic models for this channel by discussing analogies and the differences among them. The discussion is always driven by a comparison with the experimental data. We then consider the one-pion production channel where agreement between data and theory remains highly unsatisfactory. We describe how to interpret pion data, and then analyze, in particular, the puzzle related to the difficulty of theoretical models and Monte Carlo to simultaneously describe MiniBooNE and MINERvA experimental results. Inclusive cross sections are also discussed, as well as the comparison between the and cross sections, relevant for the charge-conjugation-parity violation experiments. The impact of nuclear effects on the reconstruction of neutrino energy and on the determination of the neutrino-oscillation parameters is also reviewed. Finally, we look to the future by discussing projects and efforts in relation to future detectors, beams, and analysis.},

  abstract = {Neutrinos exist in one of three types or ‘flavours’—electron, muon and tau neutrinos—and oscillate from one flavour to another when propagating through space. This phenomena is one of the few that cannot be described using the standard model of particle physics (reviewed in ref.\,1), and so its experimental study can provide new insight into the nature of our Universe (reviewed in ref.\,2). Neutrinos oscillate as a function of their propagation distance (L) divided by their energy (E). Therefore, experiments extract oscillation parameters by measuring their energy distribution at different locations. As accelerator-based oscillation experiments cannot directly measure E, the interpretation of these experiments relies heavily on phenomenological models of neutrino–nucleus interactions to infer E. Here we exploit the similarity of electron–nucleus and neutrino–nucleus interactions, and use electron scattering data with known beam energies to test energy reconstruction methods and interaction models. We find that even in simple interactions where no pions are detected, only a small fraction of events reconstruct to the correct incident energy. More importantly, widely used interaction models reproduce the reconstructed energy distribution only qualitatively and the quality of the reproduction varies strongly with beam energy. This shows both the need and the pathway to improve current models to meet the requirements of next-generation, high-precision experiments such as Hyper-Kamiokande (Japan)3 and DUNE~(USA)4.},

Previous clectroexcitation measurements in the Δ region reported a dependence of the Δ mass indicating that this potential is dependent on the momentum of the Δ. Such a dependence is not observed for protons and neutrons in the nuclear medium. This thesis presents the experimental study of the electroexcitation of the Δ resonance in performed using the high energy electron beam at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, and the near 47T acceptance detector CLAS that enables the detection of the full reaction final state. Inclusive, semi inclusive, and exclusive cross sections were measured with an incident electron beam energy of 1.162 GeV over the Q2 range 0.175 - 0.475 (GeV/c)2. No clear evidence of a dependence of the Δ mass was observed.},

  abstract = {The CEBAF large acceptance spectrometer (CLAS) is used to study photo- and electro-induced nuclear and hadronic reactions by providing efficient detection of neutral and charged particles over a good fraction of the full solid angle. A collaboration of about 30 institutions has designed, assembled, and commissioned CLAS in Hall B at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. The CLAS detector is based on a novel six-coil toroidal magnet which provides a largely azimuthal field distribution. Trajectory reconstruction using drift chambers results in a momentum resolution of 0.5\% at forward angles. Cherenkov counters, time-of-flight scintillators, and electromagnetic calorimeters provide good particle identification. Fast triggering and high data-acquisition rates allow operation at a luminosity of 1034nucleoncm−2s−1. These capabilities are being used in a broad experimental program to study the structure and interactions of mesons, nucleons, and nuclei using polarized and unpolarized electron and photon beams and targets. This paper is a comprehensive and general description of the design, construction and performance of CLAS.},

The results utilize significant improvements in both the simulations and analysis of the data. A joint fit to the data for νμ disappearance and νe appearance gives the best-fit point as normal mass hierarchy, Δm232=2.44×10−3 eV2/c4, sin2θ23=0.56, and δCP=1.21π. The 68.3\% confidence intervals in the normal mass hierarchy are Δm232∈[2.37,2.52]×10−3 eV2/c4, sin2θ23∈[0.43,0.51]∪[0.52,0.60], and δCP∈[0,0.12π]∪[0.91π,2π]. The inverted mass hierarchy is disfavored at the 95\% confidence level for all choices of the other oscillation parameters.},

  abstract = {Currently running and forthcoming precision neutrino oscillation experiments aim to unambiguously determine the neutrino mass ordering, the charge-parity violating phase in the lepton sector and the possible existence of physics Beyond the Standard Model. To have an understanding of all the effects necessary for the success of these experiments, lepton-nucleus interactions must be modeled in unprecedented detail. With this thesis, expertise in both neutrino and electron cross-section modeling and analysis was leveraged in order to make fundamental and critical improvements to our understanding of these interactions. The outlined work takes a significant step towards this high-precision measurement era with three complementary approaches. Cross sections are reported using neutrino data sets from the MicroBooNE liquid argon time projection chamber detector at Fermi National Laboratory, as well as electron scattering data from the CLAS detector at Thomas Jefferson National Laboratory. Furthermore, the modeling development of the commonly used GENIE event generator is presented.},

Using data from previous editions, plus 2,143 new measurements from 709 papers, we list, evaluate, and average measured properties of gauge bosons and the recently discovered Higgs boson, leptons, quarks, mesons, and baryons. We summarize searches for hypothetical particles such as supersymmetric particles, heavy bosons, axions, dark photons, etc. Particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We give numerous tables, figures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as Higgs Boson Physics, Supersymmetry, Grand Unified Theories, Neutrino Mixing, Dark Energy, Dark Matter, Cosmology, Particle Detectors, Colliders, Probability and Statistics. Among the 120 reviews are many that are new or heavily revised, including a new review on Machine Learning, and one on Spectroscopy of Light Meson Resonances.The Review is divided into two volumes. Volume 1 includes the Summary Tables and 97 review articles. Volume 2 consists of the Particle Listings and contains also 23 reviews that address specific aspects of the data presented in the Listings.The complete Review (both volumes) is published online on the website of the Particle Data Group (pdg.lbl.gov) and in a journal. Volume 1 is available in print as the PDG Book. A Particle Physics Booklet with the Summary Tables and essential tables, figures, and equations from selected review articles is available in print, as a web version optimized for use on phones, and as an Android app.},

  abstract = {The NOvA long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment is currently under construction and will use an upgraded NuMI neutrino source at Fermilab and a 14-kton detector at Ash River, Minnesota to explore the neutrino sector. NOvA uses a highly active, finely segmented detector design that offers superb event identification capability, allowing precision measurements of νe/ν¯e appearance and νμ/ν¯μ disappearance, through which NOvA will provide constraints on θ13, θ23, |Δmatm2|, the neutrino mass hierarchy, and the CP-violating phase δ. In this article, we review NOvAʼs uniquely broad physics scope, including sensitivity updates in light of the latest knowledge of θ13, and we discuss the experimentʼs construction and operation timeline.},

  abstract = {Cross sections for the 1H(e,e′π+)n process on 1H, 2H, 12C, 27Al, 63Cu, and 197Au targets were measured at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab) to extract nuclear transparencies. Data were taken from Q2=1.1–4.7 GeV2 for a fixed center-of-mass energy of W=2.14 GeV. The ratio of σL and σT was extracted from the measured cross sections for 1H, 2H, 12C, and 63Cu targets at Q2=2.15 and 4.0 GeV2, allowing for additional studies of the reaction mechanism. In this article, we present the experimental setup and the analysis of the data in detail, including systematic uncertainty studies. Differential cross sections and nuclear transparencies as a function of the pion momentum at different values of Q2 are presented. Our results are consistent with the predicted early onset of color transparency in mesons. Global features of the data are discussed and the data are compared with model calculations for the 1H(e,e′π+)n reaction from nuclear targets.},

The first direct detection of the neutrino, confirming its existence, was performed using reactor neutrinos. More recent experiments utilizing reactor neutrinos have also found clear evidence for neutrino oscillation, providing unique input for the determination of neutrino mass and mixing. Ongoing and future reactor neutrino experiments will explore other important issues, including the neutrino mass hierarchy and the search for sterile neutrinos and other new physics beyond the standard model. In this article, we review the recent progress in physics using reactor neutrinos and the opportunities they offer for future discoveries.},

The different (anti)neutrino processes like the quasielastic scattering, inelastic production of mesons and hyperons, and the deep inelastic scattering from the free nucleons are discussed, and the results for the scattering cross sections are presented. The polarization observables for the leptons and hadrons produced in the final state, in the case of quasielastic scattering, are also studied. The importance of nuclear medium effects in the low, intermediate, and high energy regions, in the above processes along with the processes of the coherent neutrino–nucleus scattering, coherent meson production, and trident production, has been highlighted. In some cases, the results of the cross sections are also given and compared with the available experimental data as well as with the predictions in the different theoretical models. This study would be helpful in understanding the (anti)neutrino interaction cross section with matter in the few GeV energy region relevant to the next generation experiments like DUNE, Hyper-Kamiokande, and other experiments with accelerator and atmospheric neutrinos. We have emphasized the need of better theoretical models for some of these processes for studying the nuclear medium effects in nuclei.},

  abstract = {We present a study of coherent pion production in neutrino-nucleus interactions using the formalism based on partially conserved axial current theorem which connects the neutrino-nucleus cross section to the pion-nucleus elastic scattering cross section. Pion-nucleus elastic scattering cross section is calculated using Glauber model which takes three inputs, nuclear densities, pion-nucleon cross section and απN which is the ratio of real to imaginary part of πN forward scattering amplitude, for which the parametrizations are obtained from measured data. We calculate the differential and integrated cross sections for charge and neutral current coherent pion production in neutrino (anti-neutrino)-nucleus scattering for a range of nuclear targets from light to heavy materials such as lithium, carbon, hydrocarbon, oxygen, silicon, argon, iron and lead. The results of these cross section calculations are compared with the measured data and with the calculations from the Berger-Sehgal model and GENIE package. There is an excellent agreement between the calculated and measured cross sections with Glauber model. While GENIE and Berger-Sehgal model give a good description of the data in the lower energy range the present calculations describe the data in all energy ranges. Predictions are also made for upcoming experiments like INO and DUNE in the coherent region of neutrino cross section.},

  abstract = {Studies of neutrino mixing and oscillations, solar neutrinos as background in dark matter searches involving electron detection, detection of sterile neutrino warm dark matter, and of possible electromagnetic properties of neutrinos, have generated interest in the low energy O(10 keV) scattering of electron neutrinos and antineutrinos by atomic electrons where the binding of the atomic electron cannot be ignored. Of particular interest is the ionization of atoms by neutrinos and antineutrinos. Most existing calculations are based upon modifications of the free electron differential cross section which destroy the relationship between the neutrino helicities and the orbital and spin angular momenta of the atomic electrons. The present calculations maintain the full collision dynamics by formulating the scattering in configuration space using the bound interaction picture, rather than the usual formulation in the interaction picture in momentum space as appropriate to scattering by free electrons. Energy spectra of ionization electrons produced by scattering of neutrinos and antineutrinos with energies of 5, 10, 20, and 30 keV by hydrogen, helium and neon have been calculated using Dirac central field eigenfunctions, and are presented as ratios to the spectra for scattering by free electrons. Binding effects increase strongly with atomic number, are largest for low neutrino energy and, for each neutrino energy, greatest at the high electron energy end of the spectrum. The most extreme effects of binding are for 5 keV scattering by Ne where the ratios are less than 0.1. The energy spectra have been calculated for both a Coulombic final electron state and a free final electron state. The results indicate that the binding effects from the continuum state of the final electron are significant and can be comparable to those arising from the bound initial electron state.},

In that book, Professor Zuber provided a comprehensive self-contained examination of neutrinos, covering their research history and theory, as well as their application to particle physics, astrophysics, nuclear physics, and the broad reach of cosmology; but now to be truly comprehensive and accurate, the field's seminal reference needs to be revised and expanded to include the latest research, conclusions, and implications. Revised as needed to be equal to the research of today, Neutrino Physics, Third Edition delves into neutrino cross-sections, mass measurements, double beta decay, solar neutrinos, neutrinos from supernovae, and high-energy neutrinos, as well as entirely new experimental results in the context of theoretical models. Written to be accessible to graduate students and readers from diverse backgrounds, this edition, like the first, provides both an introduction to the field as well as the information needed by those looking to make their own contributions to it. And like the second edition, it whets the researcher's appetite, going beyond certainty to pose those questions that still need answers.
